// Triangular Number Sequence

// This Triangular Number Sequence is generated from a pattern of dots
//that form a triangle. The first 5 numbers of the sequence, or dots, are:
//1, 3, 6, 10, 15. Write a function that converts n number of places with its corresponding number.
// Examples

function triangle(n) {
  return (1 + 2 + 3 + 4 + 5 + 6 = (n / 2) * (n + 1));
}

triangle(1); //➞ 1

triangle(6); //➞ 21

triangle(215); //➞ 23220
